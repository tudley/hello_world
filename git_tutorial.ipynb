    "    git --version\n",
    "\n",
    "and you'll recieve an appropriate ouput, showing git is working correctly.\n",
    "now we will configure git. This lets git know who you are.\n",
    "it uses the following information/commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "    git config --global user.name \"<username>\"\n",

    "now for this example, we will create a folder for our project, as I have done already, called git_learning\n",

    "    git init   \n",
